This article explicitly describes how such calculations are generally implemented in the ABACUS C++ library, emphasizing the universality in treatment of different cases coming as a consequence of unifying features within the Bethe Ansatz.},

Troyer, Science {\bf 355}, 602 (2017)], a method to calculate the ground state of the Bose-Hubbard model using a feedforward neural network is proposed. The results are in good agreement with those obtained by exact diagonalization and the Gutzwiller approximation. The method of neural-network quantum states is promising for solving quantum many-body problems of ultracold atoms in optical lattices.},

@article{Radford2015,
	Abstract = {In recent years, supervised learning with convolutional networks (CNNs) has seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.},

@article{Dunjko2017,
	Abstract = {Quantum information technologies, and intelligent learning systems, are both emergent technologies that will likely have a transforming impact on our society. The respective underlying fields of research -- quantum information (QI) versus machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) -- have their own specific challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely independently. However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been probing the question to what extent these fields can learn and benefit from each other. QML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML, investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve the problems of the other. Recently, we have witnessed breakthroughs in both directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups in ML, critical in our "big data" world. Conversely, ML already permeates cutting-edge technologies, and may become instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments, quantum enhancements have also been demonstrated for interactive learning, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works exploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments, and for performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement, researchers have also broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of ML/AI concepts. This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a world that is described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the main ideas, recent developments, and progress in a broad spectrum of research investigating machine learning and artificial intelligence in the quantum domain.},

We consider the one-dimensional free bosons and fermions, spinless fermions on a square lattice away from half-filling, as well as frustrated quantum magnetism with a rapidly oscillating ground-state characteristic function. In the latter case, an ANN with a standard architecture fails, while that with a slightly modified one successfully learns the frustration-driven complex sign rule in the ground state. The practical application of this method to explore the unknown ground states is also discussed.},

The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. In contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go, by tabula rasa reinforcement learning from games of self-play. In this paper, we generalise this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve, tabula rasa, superhuman performance in many challenging domains. Starting from random play, and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero achieved within 24 hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go, and convincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case.},

  abstract    = {Existing generative video models work well only for videos with a static background. For dynamic scenes, applications of these models demand an extra pre-processing step of background stabilization. In fact, the task of background stabilization may very often prove impossible for videos in the wild. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first video generation framework that works in the wild, without making any assumption on the videos' content. This allows us to avoid the background stabilization step, completely. The proposed method also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods even when the static background assumption is valid. This is achieved by designing a robust one-stream video generation architecture by exploiting Wasserstein GAN frameworks for better convergence. Since the proposed architecture is one-stream, which does not formally distinguish between fore- and background, it can generate - and learn from - videos with dynamic backgrounds. The superiority of our model is demonstrated by successfully applying it to three challenging problems: video colorization, video inpainting, and future prediction.},

  title       = {An exact mapping between the Variational Renormalization Group and Deep Learning},
  abstract    = {Deep learning is a broad set of techniques that uses multiple layers of representation to automatically learn relevant features directly from structured data. Recently, such techniques have yielded record-breaking results on a diverse set of difficult machine learning tasks in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Despite the enormous success of deep learning, relatively little is understood theoretically about why these techniques are so successful at feature learning and compression. Here, we show that deep learning is intimately related to one of the most important and successful techniques in theoretical physics, the renormalization group (RG). RG is an iterative coarse-graining scheme that allows for the extraction of relevant features (i.e. operators) as a physical system is examined at different length scales. We construct an exact mapping from the variational renormalization group, first introduced by Kadanoff, and deep learning architectures based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We illustrate these ideas using the nearest-neighbor Ising Model in one and two-dimensions. Our results suggests that deep learning algorithms may be employing a generalized RG-like scheme to learn relevant features from data.},

                  G that captures the data distribution, and a

                  probability that a sample came from the training
                  data rather than G. The training procedure for G is
                  to maximize the probability of D making a

Modern computer Go programs rely on processing millions of possible future positions to play well, but intuitively a stronger and more ’humanlike’ way to play the game would be to rely on pattern recognition rather than brute force computation. Following this sentiment, we train deep convolutional neural networks to play Go by training them to predict the moves made by expert Go players. To solve this problem we introduce a number of novel techniques, including a method of tying weights in the network to ’hard code’ symmetries that are expected to exist in the target function, and demonstrate in an ablation study they considerably improve performance. Our final networks are able to achieve move prediction accuracies of 41.1% and 44.4% on two different Go datasets, surpassing previous state of the art on this task by significant margins. Additionally, while previous move prediction systems have not yielded strong Go playing programs, we show that the networks trained in this work acquired high levels of skill. Our convolutional neural networks can consistently defeat the well known Go program GNU Go and win some games against state of the art Go playing program Fuego while using a fraction of the play time.}

                  games in the Atari 2600 domain. We then show that
                  the idea behind the Double Q-learning algorithm,
                  which was introduced in a tabular setting, can be
                  generalized to work with large-scale function
                  approximation. We propose a specific adaptation to
                  the DQN algorithm and show that the resulting
                  algorithm not only reduces the observed
                  overestimations, as hypothesized, but that this also
                  leads to much better performance on several games.},

  abstract =     {Deep Reinforcement Learning has yielded proficient
                  controllers for complex tasks. However, these
                  controllers have limited memory and rely on being
                  able to perceive the complete game screen at each
                  decision point. To address these shortcomings, this
                  article investigates the effects of adding
                  recurrency to a Deep Q-Network (DQN) by replacing
                  the first post-convolutional fully-connected layer
                  with a recurrent LSTM. The resulting \textit{Deep
                  Recurrent Q-Network} (DRQN), although capable of
                  seeing only a single frame at each timestep,
                  successfully integrates information through time and
                  replicates DQN's performance on standard Atari games
                  and partially observed equivalents featuring
                  flickering game screens. Additionally, when trained
                  with partial observations and evaluated with
                  incrementally more complete observations, DRQN's
                  performance scales as a function of
                  observability. Conversely, when trained with full
                  observations and evaluated with partial
                  observations, DRQN's performance degrades less than
                  DQN's. Thus, given the same length of history,
                  recurrency is a viable alternative to stacking a
                  history of frames in the DQN's input layer and while
                  recurrency confers no systematic advantage when
                  learning to play the game, the recurrent net can
                  better adapt at evaluation time if the quality of
                  observations changes.},

  abstract =     {Rapid progress in machine learning and artificial
                  intelligence (AI) has brought increasing attention
                  to the potential impacts of AI technologies on
                  society. In this paper we discuss one such potential
                  impact: the problem of accidents in machine learning
                  systems, defined as unintended and harmful behavior
                  that may emerge from poor design of real-world AI
                  systems. We present a list of five practical
                  research problems related to accident risk,
                  categorized according to whether the problem
                  originates from having the wrong objective function
                  ("avoiding side effects" and "avoiding reward
                  hacking"), an objective function that is too
                  expensive to evaluate frequently ("scalable
                  supervision"), or undesirable behavior during the
                  learning process ("safe exploration" and
                  "distributional shift"). We review previous work in
                  these areas as well as suggesting research
                  directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge
                  AI systems. Finally, we consider the high-level
                  question of how to think most productively about the
                  safety of forward-looking applications of AI.},
