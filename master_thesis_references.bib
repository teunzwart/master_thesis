This article explicitly describes how such calculations are generally implemented in the ABACUS C++ library, emphasizing the universality in treatment of different cases coming as a consequence of unifying features within the Bethe Ansatz.},

The results are in good agreement with those obtained by exact diagonalization and the Gutzwiller approximation. The method of neural-network quantum states is promising for solving quantum many-body problems of ultracold atoms in optical lattices.},

@article{Radford2015,
	Abstract = {In recent years, supervised learning with convolutional networks (CNNs) has seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.},

@article{Dunjko2017,
	Abstract = {Quantum information technologies, and intelligent learning systems, are both emergent technologies that will likely have a transforming impact on our society. The respective underlying fields of research -- quantum information (QI) versus machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) -- have their own specific challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely independently. However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been probing the question to what extent these fields can learn and benefit from each other. QML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML, investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve the problems of the other. Recently, we have witnessed breakthroughs in both directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups in ML, critical in our "big data" world. Conversely, ML already permeates cutting-edge technologies, and may become instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments, quantum enhancements have also been demonstrated for interactive learning, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works exploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments, and for performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement, researchers have also broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of ML/AI concepts. This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a world that is described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the main ideas, recent developments, and progress in a broad spectrum of research investigating machine learning and artificial intelligence in the quantum domain.},

We consider the one-dimensional free bosons and fermions, spinless fermions on a square lattice away from half-filling, as well as frustrated quantum magnetism with a rapidly oscillating ground-state characteristic function. In the latter case, an ANN with a standard architecture fails, while that with a slightly modified one successfully learns the frustration-driven complex sign rule in the ground state. The practical application of this method to explore the unknown ground states is also discussed.},

	Abstract = {The game of chess is the most widely-studied domain in the history of artificial intelligence. The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. In contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go, by tabula rasa reinforcement learning from games of self-play. In this paper, we generalise this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve, tabula rasa, superhuman performance in many challenging domains. Starting from random play, and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero achieved within 24 hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go, and convincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case.},

  title       = {Towards an Understanding of Our World by GANing Videos in the Wild},
  abstract    = {Existing generative video models work well only for videos with a static background. For dynamic scenes, applications of these models demand an extra pre-processing step of background stabilization. In fact, the task of background stabilization may very often prove impossible for videos in the wild. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first video generation framework that works in the wild, without making any assumption on the videos' content. This allows us to avoid the background stabilization step, completely. The proposed method also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods even when the static background assumption is valid. This is achieved by designing a robust one-stream video generation architecture by exploiting Wasserstein GAN frameworks for better convergence. Since the proposed architecture is one-stream, which does not formally distinguish between fore- and background, it can generate - and learn from - videos with dynamic backgrounds. The superiority of our model is demonstrated by successfully applying it to three challenging problems: video colorization, video inpainting, and future prediction.},

  title       = {An exact mapping between the Variational Renormalization Group and Deep Learning},
  abstract    = {Deep learning is a broad set of techniques that uses multiple layers of representation to automatically learn relevant features directly from structured data. Recently, such techniques have yielded record-breaking results on a diverse set of difficult machine learning tasks in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Despite the enormous success of deep learning, relatively little is understood theoretically about why these techniques are so successful at feature learning and compression. Here, we show that deep learning is intimately related to one of the most important and successful techniques in theoretical physics, the renormalization group (RG). RG is an iterative coarse-graining scheme that allows for the extraction of relevant features (i.e. operators) as a physical system is examined at different length scales. We construct an exact mapping from the variational renormalization group, first introduced by Kadanoff, and deep learning architectures based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We illustrate these ideas using the nearest-neighbor Ising Model in one and two-dimensions. Our results suggests that deep learning algorithms may be employing a generalized RG-like scheme to learn relevant features from data.},

The obtained phase diagram for a well-studied model of the many-body localization transition shows excellent agreement with previously known results obtained from time-independent entanglement spectra. For a periodically-driven model featuring an inherently dynamical time-crystalline phase, the phase diagram that our network traces in a previously-unexplored regime coincides with an order parameter for its expected phases.},

                  models via an adversarial process, in which we
                  simultaneously train two models: a generative model
                  G that captures the data distribution, and a
                  discriminative model D that estimates the
                  probability that a sample came from the training
                  data rather than G. The training procedure for G is
                  to maximize the probability of D making a
                  mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax
                  two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions
                  G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering
                  the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2

                  learning systems, are both emergent technologies
                  that will likely have a transforming impact on our
                  society. The respective underlying fields of
                  research -- quantum information (QI) versus machine
                  learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) --
                  have their own specific challenges, which have
                  hitherto been investigated largely
                  independently. However, in a growing body of recent
                  work, researchers have been probing the question to
                  what extent these fields can learn and benefit from
                  each other. QML explores the interaction between
                  quantum computing and ML, investigating how results
                  and techniques from one field can be used to solve
                  the problems of the other. Recently, we have
                  witnessed breakthroughs in both directions of
                  influence. For instance, quantum computing is
                  finding a vital application in providing speed-ups
                  in ML, critical in our "big data" world.
                  Conversely, ML already permeates cutting-edge
                  technologies, and may become instrumental in
                  advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum
                  speed-up in data analysis, or classical ML
                  optimization used in quantum experiments, quantum
                  enhancements have also been demonstrated for
                  interactive learning, highlighting the potential of
                  quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works
                  exploring the use of AI for the very design of
                  quantum experiments, and for performing parts of
                  genuine research autonomously, have reported their
                  first successes. Beyond the topics of mutual
                  enhancement, researchers have also broached the
                  fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of
                  ML/AI concepts.  This deals with questions of the
                  very meaning of learning and intelligence in a world
                  that is described by quantum mechanics. In this
                  review, we describe the main ideas, recent
                  developments, and progress in a broad spectrum of
                  research investigating machine learning and
                  artificial intelligence in the quantum domain.},
