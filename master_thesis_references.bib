This article explicitly describes how such calculations are generally implemented in the ABACUS C++ library, emphasizing the universality in treatment of different cases coming as a consequence of unifying features within the Bethe Ansatz.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the recent successful application of artificial neural networks to quantum many-body problems [G. Carleo and M. Troyer, Science {\bf 355}, 602 (2017)], a method to calculate the ground state of the Bose-Hubbard model using a feedforward neural network is proposed. The results are in good agreement with those obtained by exact diagonalization and the Gutzwiller approximation. The method of neural-network quantum states is promising for solving quantum many-body problems of ultracold atoms in optical lattices.},
