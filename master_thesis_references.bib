Troyer, Science {\bf 355}, 602 (2017)], a method to calculate the ground state of the Bose-Hubbard model using a feedforward neural network is proposed. The results are in good agreement with those obtained by exact diagonalization and the Gutzwiller approximation. The method of neural-network quantum states is promising for solving quantum many-body problems of ultracold atoms in optical lattices.},

  abstract    = {In recent years, supervised learning with convolutional networks (CNNs) has seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.},
